## 1. Domain Hierarchy

- **Root Domain (`.`)** â†’ top of the hierarchy.  
- **Top-Level Domain (TLD)** â†’ rightmost part (e.g., `.com`, `.edu`, `.gov`).  
  - Types:  
    - **gTLD** â†’ Generic (e.g., `.com`, `.org`).  
    - **ccTLD** â†’ Country Code (e.g., `.uk`, `.in`, `.ca`).  
- **Second-Level Domain (SLD)** â†’ name chosen by the registrant (e.g., `tryhackme` in `tryhackme.com`).  
  - Limited to 63 characters.  
  - Can use `aâ€“z`, `0â€“9`, and hyphens (cannot start or end with hyphen, no consecutive hyphens).  
- **Subdomain** â†’ part added before the SLD (e.g., `admin.tryhackme.com`).  
  - Same naming restrictions as SLD.  
  - Max 253 characters for the full domain.  
  - Unlimited subdomains possible.

## 2. DNS Record Types

- **A Record** â†’ Maps hostname to IPv4 address (e.g., `104.26.10.229`).  
- **AAAA Record** â†’ Maps hostname to IPv6 address (e.g., `2606:4700:20::681a:eb5`).  
- **CNAME Record** â†’ Alias pointing to another domain (e.g., `store.tryhackme.com` â†’ `shops.shopify.com`).  
- **MX Record** â†’ Specifies mail servers for a domain.  
  - Includes priority numbers â†’ tells clients which server to try first.  
- **TXT Record** â†’ Stores free-text data. Common uses:  
  - Email authentication (SPF, DKIM).  
  - Domain ownership verification.  
  - Custom metadata.

## 3. DNS Request Flow

Steps when you make a DNS query (e.g., `tryhackme.com`):

1. **Local Cache** â†’ Computer checks if it already knows the IP.  
2. **Recursive DNS Server** â†’ ISP or configured DNS server (Google DNS, Cloudflare, etc.).  
   - If cached locally, reply is returned.  
   - If not cached, query continues.  
3. **Root DNS Server** â†’ Directs to correct TLD server (e.g., `.com`).  
4. **TLD DNS Server** â†’ Tells which authoritative server is responsible for the SLD (e.g., Cloudflare for `tryhackme.com`).  
5. **Authoritative DNS Server** â†’ Provides the actual IP address of the domain.  
   - Stores DNS records for the domain.  
   - Returns the correct A/AAAA/CNAME/MX/TXT record.  

**TTL (Time To Live)**: Defines how long a record is cached before needing re-validation.

### ðŸ”¹ Quick Recap
- DNS translates human-readable names â†’ IP addresses.  
- Domain hierarchy = Root â†’ TLD â†’ SLD â†’ Subdomain.  
- Common records: **A (IPv4)**, **AAAA (IPv6)**, **CNAME (alias)**, **MX (mail)**, **TXT (text/authentication)**.  
- DNS resolution flow: Cache â†’ Recursive â†’ Root â†’ TLD â†’ Authoritative.
